### TODO: Finalize this

For map modders, it should be as simple as copying the contents of the `projectAssets` folder into your `contents` folder in your Tres game proejct.

**DO NOT MODIFY THEESE ASSETS!** This is simply for compatability between different map mods.

For more customized assets, make a child blurprint of the desired base asset.

Move the newly created child asset into your mod directory to prevent compatability issues.
